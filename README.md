I am trying to understand how to manipulate my arduino with RUST code. 

# 14/10/2024
The first step was to push my rust code into the arduino. I was trying on windows but i always had problems of rust version ect... I finally found a github page that explains wich version of rust and wich packages to install on linux. Now it works and i arrave to push code in my arduino. I only tried to manipulate the big LED to see if it works or not.
