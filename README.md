# HAL_Project
I am trying to understand how to manipulate my arduino with RUST code. 

In the min branch you'll find all the files you need. 

In src you'll find the main code, which contains functional and example code that turns on the LED on your arduino uno for 5s. 

In Cargo.toml you'll find all the configuration you need to run your rust code to your arduino uno. 

Then you'll find Lab1, Lab 2 etc., which are codes with different functionalities, to put in your hand.
