This Rust program allows users to control the digital pins (D0 to D13) on the Arduino Uno by directly manipulating the ATmega328p microcontroller's registers. The code defines pointers to access the Data Direction Register (DDR), the Port Register (PORT), and the Pin Register (PIN) for both PORTB and PORTD. 

It provides functionality to configure any digital pin as either an input or output, and to read or write the pin's state. The `PIN_NUMBER` constant specifies which pin to manipulate, while the `IS_OUTPUT` constant controls whether the pin is configured as an output (true) or input (false). If the pin is configured as output, the `OUTPUT_STATE` constant determines whether it is set to HIGH (true) or LOW (false). If the pin is configured as input, the program reads and stores the pin's state, allowing you to monitor whether the pin is HIGH or LOW.

To use the code, simply change `PIN_NUMBER` to the desired pin number (0 to 13), adjust `IS_OUTPUT` to true or false based on the desired pin configuration, and set `OUTPUT_STATE` accordingly if the pin is an output. After modifying these values, compile and upload the code to your Arduino Uno. You can now control or read the state of any digital pin at a low level, making this program a versatile tool for interacting with the Arduinoâ€™s digital pins.
